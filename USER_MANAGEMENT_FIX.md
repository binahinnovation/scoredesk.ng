# ✅ User Management Isolation - FIXED!

## The Problem
The User Management page (`/users/manage`) was showing users from ALL schools instead of just the current school.

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed ManageUsers.tsx
**Before**: Used `get_manageable_users()` function that returned all users
**After**: Direct query filtered by school_id

```typescript
// OLD (showed all schools)
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_manageable_users');

// NEW (shows only current school)
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select(`
    id,
    full_name,
    school_name,
    user_roles!inner (
      user_id,
      role
    )
  `)
  .eq('school_id', schoolId)  // ← This filters by school
  .order('full_name');
```

### 2. Fixed RoleAssignmentDialog.tsx
**Before**: Role creation didn't include school_id
**After**: Role creation includes school_id

```typescript
// NEW - includes school_id
.insert({
  user_id: user.user_id,
  role: selectedRole as UserRole,
  school_id: userSchoolId  // ← Added this
})
```

### 3. Fixed Import Errors
- Added missing `Textarea` import to `RoleAssignmentDialog.tsx`
- Added missing `Textarea` import to `UserEditDialog.tsx`
