# School Data Isolation - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
Multiple schools' data was being merged together. School A could see students, results, and other data from School B, School C, etc. This is a critical multi-tenancy violation.

## Solution Implemented

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES

#### 1. Created Centralized School ID Hook (`src/hooks/use-school-id.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Provides a single source of truth for the current user's `school_id`
- **Features**:
  - React hook (`useSchoolId()`) for reactive components
  - Utility function (`getCurrentUserSchoolId()`) for one-time operations
  - Automatic loading states and error handling
  - Fetches from user's profile

#### 2. Updated Student Management (`src/pages/students/StudentManagement.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ All student queries now filter by `school_id`
- ‚úÖ Student creation includes `school_id`
- ‚úÖ Classes dropdown filtered by school
- ‚úÖ Query cache keys include `school_id` for proper invalidation
- ‚úÖ Audit logs use correct `school_id`

#### 3. Updated Dashboard Data Hook (`src/hooks/use-dashboard-data.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ All counts filtered by school (students, teachers, subjects, results, classes)
- ‚úÖ Recent results filtered by school
- ‚úÖ Class distribution filtered by school
- ‚úÖ Subject performance filtered by school
- ‚úÖ Monthly trends filtered by school
- ‚úÖ Terms filtered by school

#### 4. Updated Result Entry (`src/pages/results/ResultEntry.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Classes query filtered by school
- ‚úÖ Subjects query filtered by school
- ‚úÖ Assessments query filtered by school
- ‚úÖ Terms query filtered by school
- ‚úÖ Students fetch filtered by school
- ‚úÖ Existing results fetch filtered by school
- ‚úÖ New results include `school_id` on save
- ‚úÖ Audit logs updated to use `school_id`

#### 5. Created Database RLS Migration (`supabase/migrations/20250105000000_enforce_school_isolation.sql`)
- ‚úÖ Added `get_current_user_school_id()` helper function
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive RLS policies for all tables:
  - `students` - school-level isolation
  - `results` - school-level isolation
  - `classes` - school-level isolation
  - `subjects` - school-level isolation
  - `assessments` - school-level isolation
  - `terms` - school-level isolation
  - `scratch_cards` - school-level isolation
  - `attendance` - school-level isolation
  - `question_papers` - school-level isolation
  - `profiles` - can only see users from same school
  - `user_roles` - school-filtered access

**This provides DUAL-LAYER PROTECTION:**
1. **Application-level filtering** - queries in code filter by school_id
2. **Database-level enforcement** - RLS policies prevent unauthorized access even if application code fails

### üìã REMAINING PAGES THAT NEED SIMILAR UPDATES

The following pages also need school_id filtering added to all their queries:

#### High Priority (Data Access Pages)
1. **`src/pages/results/ResultApproval.tsx`** - Result approval queries
2. **`src/pages/results/StudentResultApproval.tsx`** - Student result approval
3. **`src/pages/results/StudentAcademicReport.tsx`** - Academic reports
4. **`src/pages/analytics/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`** - Analytics queries
5. **`src/pages/ranking/ClassRanking.tsx`** - Ranking calculations
6. **`src/pages/scratchcards/ScratchCards.tsx`** - Scratch card generation and management
7. **`src/pages/students/StudentResultPortal.tsx`** - Public result checking (special case)

#### Medium Priority (Management Pages)
8. **`src/pages/classes/ClassSubjectManagement.tsx`** - Class/subject CRUD
9. **`src/pages/settings/AssessmentSettings.tsx`** - Assessment management
10. **`src/pages/settings/TermManagement.tsx`** - Term management
11. **`src/pages/questions/QuestionPaperManagement.tsx`** - Question papers
12. **`src/pages/attendance/MarkAttendancePage.tsx`** - Attendance marking
13. **`src/pages/attendance/AttendanceSummaryPage.tsx`** - Attendance reporting
14. **`src/pages/reportcards/ReportCardDesigner.tsx`** - Report card design

#### Lower Priority (System Pages)
15. **`src/pages/users/UserManagement.tsx`** - Already partially filtered, needs review
16. **`src/pages/users/CreateLoginDetails.tsx`** - User creation
17. **`src/pages/users/ManageUsers.tsx`** - User management
18. **`src/pages/branding/SchoolBranding.tsx`** - School-specific settings
19. **`src/pages/admin/AuditLogsPage.tsx`** - Audit log viewing

### üîß HOW TO APPLY THE FIX TO OTHER PAGES

For each remaining page, follow this pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Import the useSchoolId hook
import { useSchoolId } from "@/hooks/use-school-id";

// 2. Use the hook in the component
export default function YourPage() {
  const { schoolId, loading: schoolIdLoading } = useSchoolId();
  
  // 3. Update all Supabase queries to include .eq('school_id', schoolId)
  const { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['your-data', schoolId],  // Include schoolId in cache key
    queryFn: async () => {
      if (!schoolId) return [];
      
      const { data, error } = await supabase
        .from('your_table')
        .select('*')
        .eq('school_id', schoolId)  // ADD THIS LINE
        .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
        
      if (error) throw error;
      return data;
    },
    enabled: !!schoolId && !schoolIdLoading,  // Wait for schoolId
  });
  
  // 4. When inserting data, include school_id
  const createMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (data) => {
      if (!schoolId) throw new Error('School ID required');
      
      const { data: result, error } = await supabase
        .from('your_table')
        .insert([{
          ...data,
          school_id: schoolId,  // ADD THIS LINE
        }]);
        
      if (error) throw error;
      return result;
    },
  });
}
```

### üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

1. **Run the database migration**:
   ```bash
   # If using Supabase CLI locally
   supabase db push
   
   # Or apply manually in Supabase Dashboard
   # Go to SQL Editor and run the migration file content
   ```

2. **Deploy the application code**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Deploy to your hosting platform
   ```

3. **Verify the fix**:
   - Create two test school accounts
   - Add students to School A
   - Add students to School B
   - Log in as School A user - should only see School A students
   - Log in as School B user - should only see School B students

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Existing Data**: Any existing data without `school_id` will become inaccessible. Before deploying, ensure all existing records have proper `school_id` values assigned.

2. **User Assignment**: All users MUST have a `school_id` in their profile. The signup process should automatically create or assign a school.

3. **Super Admins**: The `is_current_user_principal()` function allows system administrators to access all schools if needed for support purposes.

4. **Performance**: Indexing on `school_id` columns is recommended for better query performance:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_students_school_id ON students(school_id);
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_results_school_id ON results(school_id);
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_classes_school_id ON classes(school_id);
   -- etc. for all tables
   ```

### üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] Two schools cannot see each other's students
- [ ] Two schools cannot see each other's results
- [ ] Two schools cannot see each other's classes
- [ ] Two schools cannot see each other's subjects
- [ ] Dashboard shows only school-specific data
- [ ] Result entry only shows school-specific students
- [ ] Analytics only shows school-specific data
- [ ] Scratch cards are school-specific
- [ ] User management shows only school users

### üìù NEXT STEPS

1. Apply the same pattern to remaining pages listed above
2. Test thoroughly with multiple school accounts
3. Add database indexes on `school_id` columns
4. Update any API endpoints or external integrations
5. Document the multi-tenancy architecture for future developers

## Summary

**Critical Fix Implemented**: Core school isolation is now in place at both the application and database levels for:
- Student management
- Result entry
- Dashboard data
- Database RLS policies

**Remaining Work**: Apply the same pattern to ~15 other pages following the established template above.

The hardest part is done - you now have a reusable pattern and comprehensive RLS policies that prevent data leakage even if application code has bugs.
