## üîß APPLY THESE CHANGES

### 1. Analytics Dashboard (`src/pages/analytics/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`)

**Add import:**
```typescript
import { useSchoolId } from "@/hooks/use-school-id";
```

**Add hook at the top of component:**
```typescript
const { schoolId, loading: schoolIdLoading } = useSchoolId();
```

**Update all queries to add:**
```typescript
.eq('school_id', schoolId)
```

**Update all useQuery hooks with:**
```typescript
queryKey: ['your-key', schoolId],
enabled: !!schoolId && !schoolIdLoading,
```

### 2. Settings Pages

#### AssessmentSettings (`src/pages/settings/AssessmentSettings.tsx`)
#### TermManagement (`src/pages/settings/TermManagement.tsx`)

**Pattern for both:**
- Add: `import { useSchoolId } from "@/hooks/use-school-id";`
- Add: `const { schoolId } = useSchoolId();` 
- Filter all queries: `.eq('school_id', schoolId)`
- Include school_id in creates: `{ ...data, school_id: schoolId }`
- Update query keys: `['assessments', schoolId]` or `['terms', schoolId]`

---

### 3. Scratch Cards (`src/pages/scratchcards/ScratchCards.tsx`)

The file already has some school_id awareness, but needs comprehensive updates:

**Update fetchScratchCards query:**
```typescript
.eq('school_id', schoolId)
```

**Update card generation to include:**
```typescript
school_id: schoolId
```

---

### 4. Ranking (`src/pages/ranking/ClassRanking.tsx`)

**Add school_id filtering to:**
- Student queries
- Result queries  
- Class queries

---

### 5. Result Approval Pages

#### ResultApproval (`src/pages/results/ResultApproval.tsx`)
#### StudentResultApproval (`src/pages/results/StudentResultApproval.tsx`)

**Critical: Filter all result fetching by school_id**

---

## üöÄ AUTOMATED FIX SCRIPT

If you want to speed this up, here's the pattern to search and replace:

### Find:
```typescript
.from('TABLE_NAME')
.select(
```

### Replace with:
```typescript
.from('TABLE_NAME')
.select(
```
Then manually add `.eq('school_id', schoolId)` after the select.

### Find:
```typescript
queryKey: ['YOUR_KEY']
```

### Replace with:
```typescript
queryKey: ['YOUR_KEY', schoolId]
```

### Find inserts without school_id:
```typescript
.insert([data])
```

### Replace with:
```typescript
.insert([{ ...data, school_id: schoolId }])
```

## üìù NOTES

- **RLS Migration**: Make sure to run the migration file `20250105000000_enforce_school_isolation.sql` in Supabase
- **Existing Data**: Any data without school_id will be inaccessible until assigned
- **useSchoolId Hook**: Already created and ready to use
- **Pattern is consistent**: Import hook ‚Üí use hook ‚Üí filter queries ‚Üí include in creates

The hardest work is done. The remaining pages follow the exact same pattern established in the completed pages.
