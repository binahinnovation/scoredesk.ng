## 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (3 Simple Steps - 20 minutes)

### STEP 1: Fix the "School ID Not Found" Error (10 minutes)

This is why you're seeing the error when adding classes.

**Apply Migration #2:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Open file: `supabase/migrations/20250106000000_auto_create_school_on_signup.sql`
3. Copy ALL content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
4. Paste in SQL Editor (Ctrl+V)
5. Click "RUN"
6. Should say "Success"

**Apply Migration #3:**
1. Still in SQL Editor
2. Open file: `supabase/migrations/20250106000001_fix_existing_users_without_school.sql`
3. Copy ALL content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
4. Paste in SQL Editor (Ctrl+V)
5. Click "RUN"
6. Should say "Success" with notices about users fixed

**Test:**
- Refresh your app
- Try to add a class
- Should work now! ✅

### STEP 2: Deploy Updated Code (5 minutes)

I've fixed more pages. Deploy them:

**If using Git auto-deploy (Vercel/Netlify):**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete school isolation fix"
git push
```

**If manual deploy:**
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist folder to your hosting
```

### STEP 3: Test Everything Works (5 minutes)

**Test with 2 school accounts:**

1. **Open Chrome Incognito #1**
   - Go to /signup
   - Create "Test School A"
   - Add 2 students
   - Add 1 class
   - Should all work now ✅

2. **Open Chrome Incognito #2**
   - Go to /signup
   - Create "Test School B"
   - Add 2 DIFFERENT students
   - Add 1 DIFFERENT class

3. **Verify Isolation:**
   - School A should NOT see School B's students ✅
   - School B should NOT see School A's students ✅
   - School A should NOT see School B's classes ✅
   - School B should NOT see School A's classes ✅
