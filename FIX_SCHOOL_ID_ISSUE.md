# Fix "School ID Not Found" Error

## The Problem
New signups weren't automatically getting a school created for them.

## The Solution
I created 2 new database scripts that:
1. Auto-create a school when someone signs up (from now on)
2. Fix existing users who don't have a school_id yet

---

## What You Need To Do (10 minutes)

### STEP 1: Apply First Migration (Auto-create School)

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Open this file: `supabase/migrations/20250106000000_auto_create_school_on_signup.sql`
3. Copy ALL the content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
4. Paste into SQL Editor (Ctrl+V)
5. Click "RUN"
6. Should say "Success"

**What this does**: From now on, when someone signs up, a school is automatically created for them.

---

### STEP 2: Apply Second Migration (Fix Existing Users)

1. Still in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Open this file: `supabase/migrations/20250106000001_fix_existing_users_without_school.sql`
3. Copy ALL the content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
4. Paste into SQL Editor (Ctrl+V)
5. Click "RUN"
6. Should say "Success" with some notices showing users fixed

**What this does**: Creates schools for users who already signed up without one.

### STEP 3: Test It Works

1. **Test existing user (you)**:
   - Refresh your app
   - Try to add a class
   - Should work now! ✅

2. **Test new signup**:
   - Open incognito window
   - Sign up as a new school
   - Try to add a class
   - Should work immediately! ✅

---

## Done!

After these 2 migrations, the signup issue is completely fixed:
- ✅ New signups automatically get a school
- ✅ Existing users now have schools
- ✅ No more "School ID not found" error

---
